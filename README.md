# AI Quiz Generator

This is a simple mini project built by me to learn and implement basic integration capabilities of different components within an application, no intentions to deploy :). 

This project uses React frontend integrated with Python Flask backend to deliver a functioning quiz assessment based on the content provided by the user. At the moment only .pdf, .docx and .txt file types are supported. Additionally, user can download and access a .csv file of the same quiz on the go. 

LLM integration was done using HuggingFace's Access Token and chat completion using InferenceClient. LLM model used is as follows: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528"
