print("<think>\nWe are creating 9 multiple choice questions based on the provided context about C Preprocessor Directives.\n The context covers:\n   - What the preprocessor is and its role (before compilation, not part of compiler)\n   - Types of preprocessor directives: File Inclusion, Macro Substitution, Conditional, Miscellaneous\n   - Details of each directive: #include, #define (simple and with arguments), #if, #elif, #else, #endif, #undef, #ifdef, #ifndef, #pragma, #error, #line\n   - Examples and syntax for each\n\n We'll design questions that test understanding of:\n   - The purpose of the preprocessor\n   - How each directive works\n   - Syntax and usage examples\n   - Predefined macros (like __FILE__, __LINE__, etc.)\n\n We must have 9 questions. We'll cover a range of topics from the context.\n\n Let's plan the questions:\n\n 1. General role of the preprocessor.\n 2. File inclusion directive (#include) and how it works.\n 3. Simple macro substitution (#define without arguments).\n 4. Macro with arguments (#define with parameters).\n 5. Conditional directives (#if, #elif, #else, #endif).\n 6. Undefining a macro (#undef).\n 7. Checking if a macro is defined (#ifdef, #ifndef).\n 8. Miscellaneous directives (#pragma, #error, #line) - focusing on one or two.\n 9. Predefined macros (like __DATE__, __LINE__, etc.).\n\n We'll create the JSON structure accordingly.\n\n Note: The answer choices must be designed carefully, with one correct answer and three plausible distractors.\n\n Let's create the questions one by one.\n</think>\n```json\n{\n    \"questions\": {\n        \"1\": {\n            \"question\": \"What is the primary function of the C preprocessor?\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"It compiles source code into executable programs\",\n                \"B\": \"It extends C's capabilities by processing directives before compilation\",\n                \"C\": \"It links object files during program execution\",\n                \"D\": \"It optimizes machine code for better performance\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"B\"\n        },\n        \"2\": {\n            \"question\": \"Which syntax correctly defines a simple macro to substitute PI with 3.14?\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"#define PI = 3.14\",\n                \"B\": \"#define PI 3.14;\",\n                \"C\": \"#define PI 3.14\",\n                \"D\": \"#substitute PI 3.14\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"C\"\n        },\n        \"3\": {\n            \"question\": \"What will be the output of the following code snippet?<br>#include <stdio.h><br>#define A 10<br>int main() {<br>#if A>5<br>printf(\\\"X\\\");<br>#elif A<5<br>printf(\\\"4\\\");<br>#else<br>printf(\\\"0\\\");<br>#endif<br>return 0;}\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"X\",\n                \"B\": \"4\",\n                \"C\": \"0\",\n                \"D\": \"No output\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"A\"\n        },\n        \"4\": {\n            \"question\": \"Which directive is used to include a user-defined header file from the current directory?\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"#include \\\"header.h\\\"\",\n                \"B\": \"#include <header.h>\",\n                \"C\": \"#insert header.h\",\n                \"D\": \"#add header.h\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"A\"\n        },\n        \"5\": {\n            \"question\": \"What happens when the preprocessor encounters #undef P?\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"It defines a new macro P\",\n                \"B\": \"It checks if P is defined\",\n                \"C\": \"It removes any previous definition of P\",\n                \"D\": \"It prints an error if P is undefined\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"C\"\n        },\n        \"6\": {\n            \"question\": \"Which predefined macro returns the current filename as a string during compilation?\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"__DATE__\",\n                \"B\": \"__LINE__\",\n                \"C\": \"__TIME__\",\n                \"D\": \"__FILE__\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"D\"\n        },\n        \"7\": {\n            \"question\": \"What is the purpose of #ifndef directive?\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"To include code if a macro is defined\",\n                \"B\": \"To include code if a macro is undefined\",\n                \"C\": \"To undefine an existing macro\",\n                \"D\": \"To define a new conditional block\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"B\"\n        },\n        \"8\": {\n            \"question\": \"How does the #error directive affect compilation?\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"It warns about potential errors but continues compilation\",\n                \"B\": \"It stops compilation and displays a custom error message\",\n                \"C\": \"It ignores subsequent code blocks\",\n                \"D\": \"It logs errors to a file without interrupting compilation\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"B\"\n        },\n        \"9\": {\n            \"question\": \"What distinguishes preprocessor directives from regular C statements?\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"A\": \"They begin with # and don't end with semicolons\",\n                \"B\": \"They are compiled into machine code\",\n                \"C\": \"They require parentheses for parameters\",\n                \"D\": \"They execute during program runtime\"\n            },\n            \"answer\": \"A\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```")
